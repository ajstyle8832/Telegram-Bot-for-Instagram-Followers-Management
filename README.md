## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

- A Telegram account
- An Instagram account
- Basic programming knowledge, specifically in Python

## Tutorial Outline

- **Step 1**: Create a Telegram Bot
- **Step 2**: Create an Instagram Developer Account
- **Step 3**: Get Your Instagram Access Token
- **Step 4**: Write the Python Code
- **Step 5**: Run the Python Code
- **Conclusion**

## Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

To create a Telegram bot, follow these instructions:

1. Open the Telegram app on your device.
2. Search for the **BotFather** bot and open it.
3. Type `/newbot` and send it to create a new bot.
4. Enter a name for your bot and send it.
5. Enter a username for your bot and send it.
6. **BotFather** will generate a token for your bot. Save this token as you will need it later.

## Step 2: Create an Instagram Developer Account

To set up an Instagram developer account, do the following:

1. Visit the Instagram Developer website.
2. Click on the "Register" button and follow the instructions to create a new account.
3. Once registered, navigate to the Instagram Graph API page and click "Get Started".
4. Follow the instructions to create a new app.
5. After creating your app, go to the "Roles" tab and add your Instagram account as a tester.

## Step 3: Get Your Instagram Access Token

Follow these steps to acquire your Instagram access token:

1. Visit the Instagram Basic Display API page.
2. Click on "Get Started" and follow the instructions to create a new app.
3. After setting up your app, go to the "Roles" tab and add your Instagram account as a tester.
4. Navigate to the "Settings" tab and add a valid redirect URI.
5. Move to the "Instagram Basic Display" tab and click on the "Generate Token" button.
6. Follow the instructions to generate your access token.

## Step 4: Write the Python Code

Below is an example of the Python code you can use for your bot. Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `YOUR_INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual tokens.

```python
import telegram
import requests
import time

bot = telegram.Bot(token='YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN')
access_token = 'YOUR_INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN'

def get_followers():
    url = 'https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/self/followed-by?access_token=' + access_token
    response = requests.get(url)
    followers = response.json()['data']
    return followers

def get_following():
    url = 'https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/self/follows?access_token=' + access_token
    response = requests.get(url)
    following = response.json()['data']
    return following

def follow_user(user_id):
    url = f'https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/{user_id}/relationship?access_token=' + access_token
    data = {'action': 'follow'}
    requests.post(url, data=data)

def unfollow_user(user_id):
    url = f'https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/{user_id}/relationship?access_token=' + access_token
    data = {'action': 'unfollow'}
    requests.post(url, data=data)

def send_message(chat_id, text):
    bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text=text)

def main():
    followers = get_followers()
    following = get_following()

    for follower in followers:
        if follower['id'] not in [user['id'] for user in following]:
            follow_user(follower['id'])
            send_message(follower['id'], 'Hello! I am a bot that can help you increase your Instagram followers. Follow me back to get started.')

    for user in following:
        if user['id'] not in [follower['id'] for follower in followers]:
            unfollow_user(user['id'])
            send_message(user['id'], 'Hello! I noticed that you unfollowed me. If you would like to follow me again, just let me know.')

    time.sleep(60)
    main()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Step 5: Run the Python Code

To run the Python script, follow these steps:

1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `instagram_bot.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Run the command `python instagram_bot.py`.

. The bot will start operating, following users who follow you and unfollowing those who unfollow you. It will also send a message to each user you interact with.

This tutorial helps you create a Telegram bot that automates the management of your Instagram followers. By following these steps, you can enhance your Instagram marketing strategy and grow your audience effectively.
